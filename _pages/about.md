Hey there! I graduated from William & Mary (Class of '23) with
a Bachelor's in CS and a minor in Finance.
I'm super interested in exploring the intersection of technology and financial markets.
Feel free to take a look around the website and learn more about me!

Ever since I took my first CS class, I have been in love with coding and
all the bugs that come with it.
For me, the most exciting part of programming is the process of solving problems
through creative ideas and innovative approaches.

Lately, these have been some things that have gripped my interest:

- AI Agents
- dotfiles config (and DX)
- lazygit
- React Email
- Background/cron jobs
